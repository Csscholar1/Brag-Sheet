                <h1>Hunter House Hamburgers — Employee / Shift Leader</h1>
                <p style="font-size: 25px;">10th – PRESENT, 35 hours a week (late junior year dropped to 15 hours a week due to legal reasons)</p>
                <p style="font-size: 20px;">Making burgers and fries! I quickly rose up the ranks and became a shift leader being placed in charge of 3-4 other employees typically older than me and being left in charge of the restaurant. I've been running the restaurant since before I could drive and have spent over 2000 hours there!</p>

                <p style="font-size: 25px;">9th, 25 hours a week</p>
                <p style="font-size: 20px;">During COVID I live streamed on social media to help people come together during quarantine. I grew a following of over 20,000 people across social media platforms, and made around $5,000. I take pride in the kind and inclusive community I was able to build.</p>

                <h1>CS50X — Student</h1>
                <p style="font-size: 25px;">11th (summer), 20 hours a week, 12 weeks</p>
                <p style="font-size: 20px;">I enrolled in Harvards online introduction to computer science and the art of programming! I grew a solid foundation of computer science concepts as well as gaining experience coding in C, Python, SQL, Javascript, HTML, CSS, and more. In fact I created this website as a project for the course!</p>

                <h1>Volunteering</h1>
                <p style="font-size: 25px;">9th - PRESENT, minimal hours until this summer (8 hours a week early June - PRESENT)</p>
                <p style="font-size: 20px;">I have done plenty of volunteer work during highschool, mostly tutoring, but also at food banks. Throughout highschool I have tutored kids in my neighborhood for free for around an hour once a week, it helps keep basic subjects and ideas fresh in my mind as well as helping the students excel! This summer I found an organization called UPchieve that helps underprivileged students access free tutoring. I enjoy helping other motivated students and do my best to share tips and make them better prepared than I was for the SAT and challenging courses.</p>

                <h1>Investing</h1>
                <p style="font-size: 25px;">Before 9th - PRESENT, 3 hours a week</p>
                <p style="font-size: 20px;">I have always been very money oriented as you can probably tell from other aspects of my applications (ex: essays and other extra curriculars), but I had nothing to spend the money on so I put it to work. I now have over $40,000 invested in the stock market and government bonds. I've learned a lot through investing, and I find that I learn the most when I lose money on a poor/unlucky decision. It also keeps me engaged with current changes within businesses and the market which is fun, and obviously making money without doing any real work is the greatest thing in the world!</p>
